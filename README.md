# Note-Taker

Web application that allows a user to write, save, and delete notes using an express backend. It can be utilized much like a notebook via the browser. It is deployed via Heroku [here](https://vast-peak-71817.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
### Online
Check out the app on [Heroku](https://vast-peak-71817.herokuapp.com/)

### Locally
To install and use locally, ```git clone``` this repository (or download and unzip) and in the terminal run:
```bash
npm start
```
The web app will be hosted on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

After the landing page, the note taking interface is presented where you can view any previously saved notes, create new notes and delete notes. 

These notes are saved in a `.json` file in the backend.
